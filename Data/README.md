## Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits — Dataset Documentation
### Description

This project uses the Pen-Based Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset, originally provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset contains handwritten digits (0–9) collected from 44 writers using a pressure-sensitive digital pen.
Each sample represents the trajectory of the pen captured as 16 numerical features, derived from x–y coordinates.

This dataset is widely used for:
- Multi-class classification
- Benchmarking lightweight or custom neural networks
- Testing modular architectures
- Comparing initialization and activation strategies
